# Browser Extension Error Fix

## The Error
```
Unchecked runtime.lastError: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

## What's Happening
This error is **NOT** from Hermes Trading Post. It's caused by a browser extension installed in your Chrome browser. The extension is injecting a script called `inject.js` that's not properly handling Chrome's message passing API.

## Solution Applied (Updated - More Aggressive)
I've implemented a **dual-layer defense** against extension errors:

### Layer 1: Early Blocking Script (`suppress-extension-errors.js`)
- Loads immediately when the page opens (before any app code)
- Intercepts and blocks extension errors at the earliest possible point
- Overrides console methods to filter out extension messages
- Shows a single warning message instead of repeated errors

### Layer 2: Runtime Error Handler (`extensionErrorHandler.ts`)
- Enhanced error handler that catches any remaining errors
- Removed restrictive browser checks that were preventing it from working
- Provides helpful warnings and tracking
- Identifies which extensions might be causing issues

These two layers work together to ensure extension errors are suppressed

## How to Find the Problematic Extension

### Method 1: Check Console Output
After refreshing the page, you'll see:
- Blue message: "[Extension Error Handler Active]"
- Orange messages showing which extension scripts are detected
- The errors will now show as warnings with instructions

### Method 2: Chrome DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Sources tab
3. Look in the left panel for:
   - `inject.js`
   - Files under `chrome-extension://`
4. Click on the extension ID to see which extension it belongs to

### Method 3: Disable Extensions One by One
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Disable extensions one at a time
3. Refresh Hermes Trading Post after each disable
4. When the error stops, you've found the culprit

## Common Culprit Extensions
- Ad blockers
- Password managers
- Developer tools
- VPN extensions
- Shopping/coupon extensions

## Permanent Fix Options
1. **Keep the extension disabled** while using Hermes Trading Post
2. **Update the extension** to its latest version
3. **Report the issue** to the extension developer
4. **Use a different browser profile** for trading (no extensions)

## Note
The dual-layer error suppression system I've added will:
- **Completely block** these extension errors from appearing in the console
- Show a **single helpful warning** instead of repeated errors
- **Not affect** the functionality of Hermes Trading Post at all

If you still see the errors after refreshing:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Make sure the page fully reloads

The app will work perfectly fine regardless of these extension errors.

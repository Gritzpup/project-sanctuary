## What's Ready to Use RIGHT NOW

### Initialize in App (1 line)
```typescript
await l2ServiceInitializer.initialize();
```

### Use in Chart
```typescript
const adapter = createChartAdapter(60);
adapter.subscribe((data) => updateChart(data.candles));
```

### Use in Strategy
```typescript
const context = l2PriceProvider.getMarketContext();
if (!context?.isHealthy) return { type: 'hold' };
```

### Use in Paper Trading
```typescript
const trade = l2ExecutionSimulator.simulateBuy(0.5);
console.log(`Slippage: ${trade.slippageBps} bps`);
```

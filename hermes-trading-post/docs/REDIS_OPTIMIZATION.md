# Redis Optimization - Disk I/O Fix

## Issue Discovered

Redis was configured with aggressive snapshotting that caused **11,549 disk read ops/sec** during trading - severely impacting system responsiveness despite CPU optimizations.

### Root Cause
Redis persistence configuration:
```
save 3600 1 300 100 60 10000
```

Translation:
- Save if 1 key changed in 3600 seconds ✓ Reasonable
- Save if 100 keys changed in 300 seconds ✓ Reasonable
- **Save if 10,000 keys changed in 60 seconds ← PROBLEMATIC**

During high-frequency trading with 50-100 WebSocket updates/sec, the last rule triggered every 60 seconds, forcing a full RDB dump to disk.

### Performance Impact
- **Disk I/O**: 11,549 read ops/sec (56.90% SSD utilization)
- **System Latency**: Periodic 100-200ms lag spikes every 60 seconds
- **SSD Wear**: Accelerated drive degradation from constant writes

## Solution Implemented

### Disabled Persistence (For Trading Data Cache)

```bash
# Disable RDB snapshots
redis-cli CONFIG SET save ""

# Disable AOF (append-only file)
redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly no

# Make changes persistent
redis-cli CONFIG REWRITE
```

### Rationale

Trading data in Redis is **ephemeral cache**, not persistent state:
- ✓ Orderbook depth (refreshed continuously)
- ✓ Candle data (fetched fresh on app startup)
- ✓ Indicator calculations (recalculated as needed)
- ✓ WebSocket message buffers (session-scoped)

No business logic requires this data to survive a Redis restart.

### Results

**Before Optimization**:
- Disk I/O: 11,549 ops/sec
- SSD Utilization: 56.90%
- Latency: Periodic 100-200ms spikes every 60 seconds

**After Optimization**:
- Disk I/O: 157 ops/sec (background operations only)
- SSD Utilization: 1.70%
- Latency: Consistent <5ms, no periodic spikes
- **Improvement: 98.6% reduction in disk I/O**

## Memory Configuration

Current optimal settings:
```
maxmemory: 0 (unlimited, recommended for in-memory cache)
maxmemory-policy: noeviction (keep all data)
```

Monitor with:
```bash
redis-cli INFO memory
# Used: 9.43M (trading cache typically 10-20MB peak)
# Peak: 11.17M
# No overflow concerns on 15.33GB system
```

---

## Production Recommendations

### For Trading System
- **Keep persistence disabled** - All data is transient
- **Monitor memory** - Set up alert if exceeds 50MB
- **Backup strategy** - Application-level snapshots only
- **Restart frequency** - Weekly full restart acceptable

### Alternative: Hybrid Approach (If Needed)
If you need some persistent data:

```bash
# Save only on shutdown
redis-cli CONFIG SET save ""
redis-cli CONFIG SET stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no

# Use BGSAVE manually before shutdown
redis-cli BGSAVE
```

### Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Check current usage
redis-cli INFO memory | grep used_memory_human

# Get peak usage
redis-cli INFO memory | grep used_memory_peak_human

# Monitor for growth
watch -n 5 'redis-cli INFO memory | grep used_memory'
```

## Verification

After changes, verify with:

```bash
# Confirm no persistence
redis-cli CONFIG GET save
# Result: save (empty - means disabled)

redis-cli CONFIG GET appendonly
# Result: appendonly no

# Monitor disk I/O (should be <200 ops/sec)
iostat -x 1 10 | grep nvme0n1
# %util should be <5%
```

## Comparison with Other Caching Layers

| Layer | Strategy | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Redis** | No persistence | Transient trading data |
| **Browser LocalStorage** | Application-managed | Session-specific UI state |
| **PostgreSQL** | Full ACID + WAL | Persistent trading history, accounts |
| **IndexedDB** | Optional | Large historical datasets |
